Examples of Singleton, Adapter, Factory patterns in C++ and Decorator, Facade design patterns in Python.

## Technologies
This project is created with:
* C++
* Python
* Jupyter Notebook

## Setup & Run
* Compile the C++ source code files with a C++ compiler and run the executable/output files.
```
g++ filename.cpp
```
* There are 2 different ways to run the Python files:
1. **Decorator_Facade.ipynb** can be run with Jupyter Notebook:
```
pip install jupyter
```
```
jupyter notebook
```
2. **Decorator_Facade.py** can be run directly with Python:
